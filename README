Skia is a complete 2D graphic library for drawing Text, Geometries, and Images.

See full details, and build instructions, at https://sites.google.com/site/skiadocs/home

This version of Skia is adapted for use by the Servo project and rust-azure. Changes
from upstream Skia:

    * The addition of Cargo build rules.
    * The addition of a native GL surface type that wraps platform-specific
      shareable surfaces.
    * Adjustment of the default glyph cache size for multi-task usage.

This branch is based on 0349864b75317ba66232df827e84ef7c25e34cfe from June 16,
2014. The upstream repository was found at https://skia.googlesource.com/skia.git/.
The procedure for updating Skia is to rename this branch and then rebase
it onto the new upstream revision.
